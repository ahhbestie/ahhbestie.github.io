        <p>
            ahh so this is the first day. Well, now what to say about me. Well this is before i've seen yours so like mine might be more or less so like ill
            know how to make day 2 lol. Well ill just list some basic things, some ive already told you some not. Well yeah so i live in St. Louis in Missouri, I have three other
            siblings, two brothers and a sister, and im the oldest. I go to an all boys catholic private school, which i mean like, isn't *too* bad but like the no girls thing kinda sucks lol. also
            it's pretty conservative so like kill me LMAO. Yeah, and i have like a group of 5 friends there but im not nearly as close with any of them as i'd like to be.
            Uhhhh for what else, i really don't know lol. Here's a simple drawing for you. I'll try and make new drawings every day for this. I'll come up with a better idea for what
            to put for the second day later todayday (its currently 1:11am so i can't call it tomorrow when its technically today.) You're amazing bestie, never forget that. Thank you
            for coming into my life and making it so so so much better.

            to say how AMAZING AND PERFECT YOU ARE. (i'd expect a compliment in every advent calendar day btw, lmao). hmm okay well now ill just talk a bit more about myself i guess.
            hmm. well my main interests as of now are coding (learning html and css), any other computer stuff, anime, and that's about it tbh. OH WAIT I FORGOT ONE. you.
            HAHA BET YA DIDN'T EXPECT THAT GET REKT. all of my interests take a backseat when it comes to you. well more like thrown out of the fucking car lol. like,
            you're so amazing. and wonderful. and lovely. and loving. and just the sweetest person ever. im so happy you're my friend. HAHA SORRY FOR THE COMPLIMENT BOMB.
            HAHA. okay now here i present to you two photos. a drawing :P and a hand reveal again cause i didn't know what else to add LMAO. I'll definitely have better drawings for the 
            calendar days this weekend when i might have more time to put into them (even though they still won't even come the slightest to getting anywhere near as fucking amazing as
            your masterpieces of art). you're amazing bestie. you're so adorable.
