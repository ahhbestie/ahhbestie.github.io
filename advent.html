        <p>
            ahh so this is the first day. Well, now what to say about me. Well this is before i've seen yours so like mine might be more or less so like ill
            know how to make day 2 lol. Well ill just list some basic things, some ive already told you some not. Well yeah so i live in St. Louis in Missouri, I have three other
            siblings, two brothers and a sister, and im the oldest. I go to an all boys catholic private school, which i mean like, isn't *too* bad but like the no girls thing kinda sucks lol. also
            it's pretty conservative so like kill me LMAO. Yeah, and i have like a group of 5 friends there but im not nearly as close with any of them as i'd like to be.
            Uhhhh for what else, i really don't know lol. Here's a simple drawing for you. I'll try and make new drawings every day for this. I'll come up with a better idea for what
            to put for the second day later todayday (its currently 1:11am so i can't call it tomorrow when its technically today.) You're amazing bestie, never forget that. Thank you
            for coming into my life and making it so so so much better.

            to say how AMAZING AND PERFECT YOU ARE. (i'd expect a compliment in every advent calendar day btw, lmao). hmm okay well now ill just talk a bit more about myself i guess.
            hmm. well my main interests as of now are coding (learning html and css), any other computer stuff, anime, and that's about it tbh. OH WAIT I FORGOT ONE. you.
            HAHA BET YA DIDN'T EXPECT THAT GET REKT. all of my interests take a backseat when it comes to you. well more like thrown out of the fucking car lol. like,
            you're so amazing. and wonderful. and lovely. and loving. and just the sweetest person ever. im so happy you're my friend. HAHA SORRY FOR THE COMPLIMENT BOMB.
            HAHA. okay now here i present to you two photos. a drawing :P and a hand reveal again cause i didn't know what else to add LMAO. I'll definitely have better drawings for the 
            calendar days this weekend when i might have more time to put into them (even though they still won't even come the slightest to getting anywhere near as fucking amazing as
            your masterpieces of art). you're amazing bestie. you're so adorable.

            Hiya bestie emms, im typing this up while you're watching a movie with your mumm. :). I feel so bad for you cause you had a really really
            bad day :((. Bestie, im sorry i suck at this lol. I just want to say that you're amazing, you really are the best. You're the sweetest.
            Thank you for everything. Thank you for making that audio clip cause OML BESTIE HOLY FUCK. THAT WAS FUCKING AMAZING OH MY GOD. THANK YOU
            SO FUCKING MUCH OML. Bestie, you're the sweetest and cutest and most adorable and like just holy FUCK. I know you're gonna say
            you aren't that way to everyone and that might be true (which fucking sucks ass cause they need to come to their senses lol) but like
            you're those things to me. Like, i haven't known you for all too long but you're my best friend lol. You mean the world to me, emms.
            Sorry for this fucking compliment bomb. I hope you are doing better after watching a movie with your mom :)). you're fucking amazing bestie.
            and also i kind of forgot the whole purpose of these was to tell you about myself. wellll i don't know what to say really. im pretty
            boring tbh. I guess I'll talk a bit about childhood and my family idk, and this might be a kind of long one lol. Welll I went to a catholic
            private school preschool through eigth grade lol. It was eh. most of the poeple sucked. im still in contact with three kids from there, one
            i carpool with and live right by and he was in my grade with another being a year below me and he's okay. he's kind of douchey i guess
            you could say but he did snap me on snapchat yesterday and ask me for my pronouns which was really nice. kind of out of the blue too cause
            i haven't told him anything about that. The other one was a year above me and he's like my best irl friend. He's very great. He's like one of my two
            irl lgbt friends lol but he's the one i actually talk to outside of school (even though this kid doens't go to my school). I'll talk with him
            about every day prolly usually just a bit, about music lol. He's helped me too though, although a lot of the times i feel like i can't talk with
            him about some stuff. Idk. it's whatever, he's pretty great. uhh and family wise, my parents really aren't too bad. They definitely
            are pretty like, helicopter-y lol. Mainly my mom. My dad though is the one i wish i had a stronger relationship with. Like, ill just try a lot
            to i guess have him say he's proud of me or something and he just doesn't. I'm sure he is just like, i need that verbal reaffirmation. Sorry for this complete
            fucking dump of stuff. I don't know if it was the best time for me to talk about that lol. I'm sorry if that's the case. You're amazing bestie, you
            really are. I'll always be here for you. Always. You're the best. I love you bestie, sm! Oh and below are some doodles i made in math class
            when bored lol. I hope you can see them well, if you need i can send them in the discord for a clearer view. You're absolutely amazing
            bestie. I'm really sorry you had a shitty day today. May tomorrow and every other day that follows be much much better. Once again lol, i love you bestie so much! (and
            here's where the hearts would go but if i do the less than sign then it thinks im making a line of code or whatever lmfao). I really
            hope this isn't too much. You're fabulous.
